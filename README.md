## WHAT IS BLOOD PLASMA?

Plasma – the liquid portion of your blood – can be easily replaced by your body. It consists mainly of water, proteins and antibodies that help your body to function. If you have survived COVID-19 then your plasma includes antibodies that could help others fight the virus.

## HOW IS BLOOD PLASMA USED?

Plasma from those who have recovered could be a key part of the fight against COVID-19. Once the COVID-19 plasma is donated, it can take one of two paths: be directly transfused into patients or be used to make a potential medicine.
